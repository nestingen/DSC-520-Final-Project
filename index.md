## Predictive Analytics: Poverty Rate

It is important to understand what drives poverty. When the society understands what the main drivers of poverty are, they can be a more directed approach to combat it. By understanding what factors contribute most to unemployment rate, there could be more focused help on providing assistance to struggling counties. I have combined 4 data sets together to create a master file. There is a data set for poverty, unemployment, population, and education. In my final model, I used data from poverty, unemployment, and education. I started by creating scatterplots with poverty rate in 2018 as the dependent variable versus each of the main independent variables. The independent variables I was focused on included Population Estimate in 2018, Rural Urban Continuum Code 2013, 2013 Urban Influence Code, Percent of adults with less than a high school diploma 2014-18, Percent of adults with a high school diploma only, 2014-18, Percent of adults completing some college or associate's degree, 2014-18, and Percent in Unemployment 2018. From this investigation, I found that population had little to do with unemployment rate in 2018.
